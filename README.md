### Elazar Gershuni

I build programming-language and static-analysis systems.

I am the chief maintainer of [PREVAIL](https://github.com/vbpf/ebpf_verifier), an abstract-interpretation eBPF verifier, and I am porting it to Rust in [prevail-rust](https://github.com/elazarg/prevail-rust).

My main work right now is the Vegas program:
- foundations for reasoning about strategic protocols,
- the [vegas](https://github.com/elazarg/vegas) compiler, which turns specifications into analyzable and executable artifacts,
- [thrones](https://github.com/elazarg/thrones), a workbench for interactive game-theoretic analysis.

The thread across this work is practical rigor at the boundary of game theory, blockchain protocols, formal verification, HCI and applied cryptography.

Other projects:
- [pythia](https://github.com/elazarg/pythia): static analysis for Python bytecode.
- [nakdimon](https://nakdimon.org): Hebrew NLP.
- [mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy): contributor; I especially valued working with Guido van Rossum and the team through GitHub collaboration.
- [anyway](https://github.com/hasadna/anyway/): civic-tech contribution to road-safety transparency.

Selected publication:
- [Simple and Precise Static Analysis of Untrusted Linux Kernel Extensions (PLDI 2019)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3314221.3314590)
