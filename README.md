### Hi, I'm Elazar Gershuni! ðŸ‘‹
I'm a Ph.D. candidate at the Technion. I am the principal maintainer of [the new eBPF verifier](https://github.com/vbpf/ebpf_verifier) that is part of the [ebpf-for-windows](https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/opensource/2021/05/10/making-ebpf-work-on-windows/) project, initiated by Microsoft. I am working on formal verification of software, and Hebrew NLP (check out [this diacritizer](https://nakdimon.org)). I have contributed heavily to [mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy/), [anyway](https://github.com/hasadna/anyway/) and recently to IBM's 
 [np-guard](https://github.com/np-guard/models).
